## Gameplay

space throws the player into a conceptual void primarily filled with nullspace. 
In the deep corners of the void there exists webs, portals which carry the player through the different stages of the game. These webs signify connection in it's purest form. 
Along the way, the player must battle monsters and wack through the dead forests found throughout the void. As the player traverses through webs and nears escape, the difficulty grows. 
The player can purchase weapons and shields from a merchant found in one of the webs to improve battle stats.
The end goal is a paradise, which is represented visually as an ordinary grass field on earth, signifying the beauty and rarity of life.
